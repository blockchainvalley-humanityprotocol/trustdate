Before starting the project:

1. Copy the .env.example file to create a .env.local file
2. Update the NEXT_PUBLIC_HUMANITY_API_KEY value with your issued API key
3. Run npm install and then npm run dev to start the development server

Note: Do not include actual API keys in .env files. These files are added to .gitignore to prevent them from being pushed to git.
